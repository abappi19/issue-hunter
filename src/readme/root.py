DEFAULT_HEADER = f"""# Issue Hunter

Issue Hunter tracks **unassigned, open issues** across popular open-source
projects, so contributors can quickly find real work to pick up.

A GitHub Action re-scans every tracked repository when run by hand and rebuilds
the tables below with the current unassigned-issue count for each one. Click
a repo's count to jump straight to its live, filtered issue list on GitHub,
or its name to open its page here, listing the most recently opened
unassigned issues waiting for someone to pick them up.

## Want to add a repo?

Open a pull request adding `"owner/repo"` to `data/repos.json`. A CI check
automatically verifies that the repo clears our popularity bar (currently
at least {MIN_STARS:,} stars) and is open to outside contributions -- not
archived, with forking and issues both enabled -- before it can be merged.
